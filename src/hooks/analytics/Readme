Following things we would like to keep track of 
for analytics:-

1. There are constraints set up by the server on various 
services or components. For example: There could be products 
that any user can only add to bag up to a certain amount. 
We would like to keep track of when this happens. As, if this 
happens for many users then manufacturer may wanna focus 
on producing more of this product. Essentially we want to 
perform analytics on demand of all products. 

2. Number of clicks a product gets, 
3. Number of people that have/had this product in There
